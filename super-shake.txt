STEP 1 Pick a liquid
Water
Almond milk (unsweetened)
Cow’s milk
Soy milk (unsweetened)
Hemp milk (unsweetened)
Iced green tea

Less liquid = thick shakes. More liquid = thin shakes. 4-8 oz is a good starting
point for each serving.

STEP 2 Pick a protein powder
Whey protein
Casein protein
Pea protein
Rice protein
Hemp protein
Other proteins or protein blends

Some protein powders contain thickeners, which will increase the thickness of
your shake. Find the protein supplement that you like best. 1-2 scoops should be
sufficient (25-50 g).

STEP 3 Pick a veggie
Dark leafy greens: Spinach / Swiss chard / kale
Pumpkin / sweet potato
Beets / beet greens
Cucumber / celery
Powdered greens supplement

Spinach is usually your best bet, as it is virtually flavorless in your Super
Shake. Canned pumpkin is great too. It goes well with vanilla. When using beets,
try roasting them and removing the skin first. Beets pair well with
chocolate. If you add celery or cucumber, you’ll need to use less liquid in your
shake. Add 1-2 handfuls.

STEP 4 Pick a fruit
Apples
Bananas
Berries
Cherries
Dates
Pineapple / mango
Powdered fruit supplement

Toss in half a banana to give the shake an excellent consistency. Dates go a
long way, as they’re very sweet (and make sure to get rid of the pit
first!). Apples are easy — simply remove the core and slice into wedges. You can
use fresh or frozen fruit. Aim for 1-2 cupped handfuls.

STEP 5 Pick a healthy fat
Walnuts
Flax, hemp, chia seeds
Cashews
Almonds
Peanut and nut butters

When blended well, nuts and seeds give the shake a nice, rich consistency. 1-2
thumbs is usually enough.

STEP 6 Pick a topper
Coconut
Cacao nibs / dark chocolate
Yogurt
Oats / granola
Cinnamon
Ice cubes (if using fresh fruit)

Cinnamon is good with vanilla and pumpkin. Add oats if you need extra carbs,
yogurt if you want more protein and a smoother consistency. For all of these, a
little goes a long way.
